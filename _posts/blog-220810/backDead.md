It has been a while, but I finally had some spare time to get back into setting up a blog site on GitHub. The are several reasons I returned.

# 1. Getting used to writing
I am currently in the process of writing scientific publications for my PhD. And while this process of writing is different to writing a blog post,
I thought it might be a good exercise for getting used how to structure blocks of text, getting in the mindset of writing, and overall keeping track of
the development of my writing progress.

# 2. Projects and learning things
Especially, this year I got more into data analysis, visualization, etc. ... I learned this techniques only superficially, as I jumped from one cool thing
to the next. Some time ago I was introduced to a rule of thumb which I call *effort principle* for now. Calling it a principle is maybe a little bit
exaggerated, but it states that if you put a little effort (like writing it down) into a thing you just learned, the chances of retaining this knowledge 
is much higher. So, I thought, why not giving it a try. 

# 3. Communication and structuring my process of thought
This point is connected to the first statement. It helps me to improve my communication skills by structuring my thoughts via finding a common thread
or a good way to explain something to someone else. Additionally, it helps me to identify the crucial points I need to convey to my counterpart.

I hope I can get through with this process and will publish a new post soon!
